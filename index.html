Knowledge becomes a moral lie detector: keep the commandments or you are counterfeit. Love is not a feeling here; it’s the price of belonging, and the penalty for refusal is darkness so thick you can’t even tell where you’re going.

Simeon’s “light” arrives like a blade. The child is carried in as an offering, and the old man reads him as an instrument that will sort the crowd by breaking it: fall for some, rising for others. The revelation is not gentle illumination; it is exposure. Hearts are opened by contradiction, and Mary is told that intimacy with this light will wound her. Salvation comes with dread built in: to be seen is to be judged, and to love is to submit to a command that keeps cutting until nothing hidden remains.</div></div><div class="semina-verbi"><div class="section-kicker is-strong">Semina Verbi</div><div class="semina-verbi-text">John’s voice is hard-edged: “knowing” is not an idea but a tested intimacy. Psychology first, theology second. If your life does not bend toward the beloved—toward concrete restraint, repair, fidelity—then the claim to insight is self-deception dressed as certainty. The text treats hatred not as a single act but as a weather system: it darkens perception, warps navigation, makes the world unreadable. Love, by contrast, is clarity; it is the condition in which you stop tripping over other people.

Luke sets that ethic inside a human arc of waiting. Simeon is the mind that has carried a promise for so long it has become his breathing; when the child arrives, the body relaxes into release. The “light” here is not mere cheer; it is exposure. A life that reveals will also provoke. Simeon names the fracture line: some will rise because they can bear being seen; some will fall because they cannot. And Mary is told that to love what is vulnerable is to accept a blade: the cost of attachment is pain, and pain becomes the instrument by which hidden motives surface.

Semina Verbi, briefly and speculative: this reads like the Bhagavad Gita’s insistence that real knowledge shows up as disciplined action, and like Stoic practice where virtue is proven in conduct, not speech. Simeon’s long patience echoes the Buddhist image of ripening karma and the quiet readiness of the bodhisattva, while the “sword” resembles the Sufi and Zen motif that awakening cuts through the heart’s attachments. In each, light is both comfort and confrontation.</div></div></section><footer class="page-footer"><div class="footer-note">Scripture text: <a class="source-link" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8300">Douay-Rheims 1899 American Edition (DRA)</a> — public domain.
