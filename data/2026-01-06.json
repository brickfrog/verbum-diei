    "seminaVerbi": "John turns love into a diagnostic, not a decoration: the self is known by what it can sustain. “God is charity” reads psychologically as the claim that reality’s deepest grain is outgoing, self-giving regard, and that to refuse love is to fall out of contact with what is most real. The sharper twist is precedence: you do not climb into love by effort; you awaken inside a love already in motion. “Propitiation” names the way guilt and fear get metabolized so relationship can restart; the divine initiative absorbs the rupture so the human can live.\n\nMark stages that interior claim as a social scene. Compassion appears first as attention: he sees them, names their leaderlessness, then teaches. When the disciples try to manage scarcity by dispersal, he forces a different imagination: you feed them. The miracle is less spectacle than a re-training of perception and agency. He takes what is already there, organizes the crowd into human-sized groups, blesses, breaks, and distributes through the disciples. Abundance arrives as a pattern: gratitude, fracture, mediation, shared order. The twelve baskets feel like the psyche’s residue of grace—evidence that generosity doesn’t merely meet need; it leaves capacity behind.\n\nSemina Verbi: this resembles the Mahayana bodhisattva’s vow to let compassion precede merit, and the Buddhist insight that clinging to lack produces more lack (speculation). It echoes Sufi talk of love as the substance of God and the human as the place where divine love recognizes itself. It rhymes with Hindu anna-dāna, food-giving as sacred duty, and with Jewish tzedakah as justice enacted through concrete provision. In all of them, the shift is from counting to care, from isolated survival to shared life.",
    "excursus": "John’s “love” is not warmth; it is domination made holy. If God loves first, then love begins as an invasion, not a choice. You don’t rise toward God; you are claimed, preempted, placed in debt. “Propitiation” is the word that gives away the bargain: something must be paid down, something in God must be satisfied. The beloved are told to love because they have already been bought.\n\nMark stages the same structure in flesh. The crowd is called sheep, which sounds tender until you notice what sheep are for. Jesus sees them, feels compassion, then organizes them into ranks on green grass like a controlled pasture. The miracle is not only food; it is compliance. The disciples want scarcity to disperse the bodies; Jesus wants the bodies gathered, counted, seated, managed.\n\n“Give you them to eat” lands like a threat: you will become the conduit of my excess. Bread appears through a chain of handing-over, and the crowd’s fill comes with leftovers counted into twelve baskets, a neat inventory of surplus. Desire is met, but under supervision. Love here is the power to feed you so thoroughly you can’t pretend you were ever free.",
    "synthesis": "God’s love is prior, objective, and atoning, and it generates a community ordered under Christ’s provision. Divine charity both teaches and feeds, binding doctrine and sustenance into one economy of salvation.",
