    "seminaVerbi": "John strips “love of God” of its perfume and makes it falsifiable. If you can’t love the brother in front of you, your God-talk is self-flattery. The unseen is tested by the seen. The psyche here is allergic to spiritual abstraction: it treats contempt as a diagnostic sign. Hatred isn’t a mere moral failure; it’s evidence the inner story is counterfeit.\n\n“Commandments are not heavy” is not sentimental. It’s a claim about desire. When you’re “born of God,” the weight shifts from white-knuckled compliance to a new appetite; the world’s seductions lose their glamour because a deeper attachment has taken root. Faith “overcomes” precisely because it is not a private opinion but a re-trained loyalty that expresses itself as concrete charity.\n\nLuke shows how that interior re-ordering turns outward. Jesus reads Isaiah as autobiography and then, with one sentence, detonates the room: the text isn’t about some later hero; it’s happening now. The poor, the captives, the bruised are not props for piety but the chosen theater of God’s action. The Nazareth line, “Is not this the son of Joseph?”, is the reflex of familiarity: we prefer the divine at a safe distance, not wearing the face we already think we understand.\n\nSpeculation: the test “love the one you see” echoes Confucian ren, where virtue is proven in relational duty, and Buddhist metta, where awakening is measured by unforced goodwill toward beings. The “light burden” of commandments resembles the Daoist sense that alignment makes action effortless. The manifesto for the poor and captive parallels the Hebrew jubilee and also the Stoic idea that philosophy’s proof is liberation, not rhetoric. Here, liberation is not escape from the world but a new way of inhabiting it, beginning with the people nearest, least impressive, and most inconvenient.",
    "excursus": "John’s “love” reads like a loyalty test disguised as tenderness. God loved first, so you are already in debt; the interest is your brother. If you fail to love the one you can see, you are not merely cold, you are counterfeit, a liar. The text doesn’t soothe; it surveils. It presses the private claim “I love God” into public proof, as if the only way to touch the invisible is by handling the nearest body without flinching.\n\n“His commandments are not heavy” is the most chilling line. It denies your experience of weight, implying the burden is not the law but you. The world to be “overcome” is not some pagan outside; it is the ordinary resistance in you that wants love to stay abstract, clean, and uncostly. Faith wins by becoming a kind of appetite that makes obedience feel natural, even when it humiliates you.\n\nIn Nazareth, Jesus stages fulfillment like a performance of intimacy: he chooses the passage, reads it, sits, and lets their stare ripen. “This day” is desire made immediate, the poor and captive promised relief now, not later. And then the room curdles into recognition: “Is not this the son of Joseph?” They crave a savior, but not one with a hometown, not one who brings the claim too close to their faces. The gospel offers liberation, but it begins by trapping the hearer in a gaze: you wanted good news; here it is, in your ears, in your street, in someone you think you already understand.",
    "synthesis": "God’s prior love establishes a new birth that is proven by obedient charity toward the visible brother. Christ’s proclaimed fulfillment inaugurates liberation that simultaneously constitutes judgment in the present.”",
    "gospel": [
      {
        "text": "Luke frames Jesus’ mission statement as a public legal claim: anointing authorizes proclamation, proclamation creates a reordered social field (poor, captives, blind, bruised), and “today” collapses promise into event. The juxtaposition of “acceptable year” with “day of reward” binds mercy to judgment; liberation is not mere relief but the inbreaking of a reign that evaluates.",
