    "seminaVerbi": "John writes like a mind trying to stabilize itself by stacking witnesses. Belief is not a soft mood; it is the act that “overcomes the world,” meaning the crush of appearances, pressure, contagion, shame. Water and blood are not tidy symbols but stubborn bodily facts: washing and wounding, initiation and cost. The self is asked to carry testimony “in himself,” to become its own courtroom where doubt is not curiosity but an accusation that corrodes trust from the inside.\n\nLuke shows what that trust looks like under skin. The leper does not argue theology; he risks approach. Jesus touches first, then speaks. The cure is immediate, but the reintegration is procedural: priest, offering, public proof. And then the strange discipline of silence, as if attention itself is a kind of disease that spreads. Power draws crowds; he retreats to the desert to keep his agency from being eaten by demand.\n\nSpeculation: the threefold witness echoes legal psychology and also older triads that bind inner conviction to outer rite and lived consequence. Hinduism’s satyam-jñānam-ānandam, Buddhism’s triple jewel, and Stoicism’s reason-nature-virtue all triangulate truth by multiple registers rather than one claim. The leper’s cleansing by touch has kinship with Buddhist karuṇā and Sufi baraka, where proximity to the holy transmits courage back into the broken body.",
    "excursus": "John reads like a mind trying to outrun contamination by turning belief into a private organ: “the testimony…in himself.” It isn’t triumphal; it’s defensive. The world is not “overcome” by argument but by a hard narrowing of perception until only one Name is allowed to count as life. Everything else becomes death by definition, and disbelief isn’t mistaken, it’s criminal: it “makes him a liar.” The dread here is of ambiguity, of mixed signals, of a universe where water washes but blood still stains. So the letter multiplies witnesses the way an anxious person repeats a story until it feels true.\n\nLuke puts the dread on skin. The leper is “full” of it, saturated, already exiled while alive. He asks permission to be re-admitted to touch. Jesus answers with touch first, not purity; he risks becoming the thing he heals. Then comes the strangest move: silence. Don’t tell. Go to the priest. Make the cure into paperwork, a “testimony,” as if reintegration requires an institution to certify what the body already knows. Fame defeats secrecy; crowds turn healing into appetite.\n\nThe heterodox link is that “testimony” is not proof of divinity but a management of desire. People want cleansing the way they want certainty: immediate, total, socially recognized. Jesus keeps slipping away to the desert because every cure creates more hunger, and every witness creates more pressure. Water, blood, spirit: not mystical elements but the brutal trio of being human—washed, wounded, breathing—and the terror that none of it is stable unless someone authoritative calls it one.",
