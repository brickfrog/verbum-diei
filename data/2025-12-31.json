  "commentary": {
    "seminaVerbi": "1 John reads like group therapy under pressure. “Last hour” is not a calendar prediction but an emotional climate: the moment when loyalties harden and exits reveal what was already true. The “antichrists” are not monsters but breakaway mirrors, people who learned the language of belonging and then used it to justify separation. The community metabolizes betrayal by narrating it as disclosure: they left because they were never really here. It is a protective story, but also a diagnostic one. It names a psychological law: when a shared center is real, it produces endurance; when it is performative, it collapses at cost.\n\nThe “unction” is the counterweight to paranoia. Not omniscience, but an interior steadiness that lets you recognize the texture of truth without chasing every new voice. It is confidence that the core has been given, not invented. The letter’s edge is sharp: it draws a line between truth and lie because a wounded group cannot survive if it treats every competing narrative as equally nourishing.\n\nJohn’s prologue supplies the deeper frame: reality is intelligible because it is spoken. The Word is not mere information; it is the source-pattern by which things cohere. “Life” and “light” describe consciousness waking to meaning, and darkness is not ignorance so much as refusal, the will not to see. The tragedy is intimate: the world is made through the Word and yet fails to recognize its own origin; the familiar rejects what would make it whole.\n\nThen the scandal: the Word becomes flesh. The highest meaning consents to limitation, time, appetite, vulnerability. Psychology calls this integration: the ideal descends into the body so the person can be real. “Dwelt among us” is presence, not theory; witness replaces speculation. Grace “for grace” suggests a surplus that keeps arriving, not a single crisis but an ongoing replenishment.\n\nSemina Verbi: the Logos echoes the Stoic logos spermatikos and Philo’s Logos (speculation: John may be transfiguring that intellectual air into a personal, embodied claim). The light that “enlighteneth every man” resonates with the Buddhist image of innate buddha-nature and with Advaita’s witness-consciousness, both insisting that awakening is already seeded in the human condition. The Word made flesh parallels Hindu avatara and Mahayana bodhisattva compassion, where ultimate reality bends toward the finite for the sake of rescue. The “unction” resembles Sufi ma‘rifa, a tasted knowing, and Quaker “inner light,” a truth recognized inwardly rather than imposed.",
    "excursus": "“Last hour” is not a calendar prediction but a panic attack that never ends. The community is splitting, and the writer converts the wound into an apocalypse: if you leave, you become Antichrist. The dread is that the center cannot hold, so the text invents a test that cannot fail—true ones stay, leavers were never true. It’s a defense mechanism dressed as revelation.\n\nAgainst that anxiety, the prologue’s cosmic grandeur feels like overcompensation: the Word made everything, the Light hits every eye, and still the world doesn’t know him. Desire here is humiliating. God wants recognition and doesn’t get it. Incarnation becomes a risky bid for intimacy—“dwelt among us”—and the result is refusal.\n\nSo “unction” is less secret knowledge than a sedative: you already know all things, stop looking elsewhere. The lie isn’t an argument; it’s the possibility that the outside might be real, might have light too. The darkness “did not comprehend” because comprehension would mean surrender, and both sides refuse it: the secessionists refuse the group, the group refuses to admit the loss. In the middle stands John the witness, not the light, just a voice trying to hold a dissolving world together by pointing at a brightness that keeps getting rejected.",
