    "synthesis": "Sirach casts Elijah as fiery agent who restrains wrath and repairs the covenant order; Matthew relocates that Elijah-work into John, where ‘restoration’ is inaugurated not by acclaim but by misrecognition, and the same pattern is slated to fall on the Son after the mountain’s unveiled glory.",
    "excursus": "Sirach gives you Elijah as a combustive principle: not merely a man with miracles, but a walking theophany whose “word” is pyroclastic—speech as flame, rhetoric as judgment. The text admires him the way iron admires the magnet: with fear disguised as encomium. The famine and the fire are not “power demonstrations” but covenantal enforcement, i.e., God’s politics executed through a zealot. Sirach also does something sly: Elijah is both catastrophe and katechon. He shuts heaven (de-creation), yet he’s “recorded” to pacify anger before it becomes wrath (re-creation). That’s a priestly function attributed to a prophet: he is filed away like an apotropaic document to be produced “in their seasons.” The famous “turn the heart of the father to the son” is not sentimental therapy; it’s civilizational re-binding, the repair of generational discontinuity that makes a people governable again. “Restore the tribes of Jacob” is national, not merely spiritual: a promise of reconstitution after dispersion. Sirach’s last line—“we also shall surely live”—rides on this: Elijah guarantees futurity.\n\nMatthew, coming down from the mountain, immediately plays the esoteric card: secrecy until resurrection. Transfiguration is too raw to circulate without the interpretive key of the cross; otherwise you get a triumphalist cult with no cruciform grammar. Then the disciples ask the scribal question, and Jesus answers with a double register: Elijah “will” come and Elijah “has” come. That’s not confusion; it’s a deliberate temporal folding. On the surface, it identifies John as Elijah. Underneath, it preserves an unspent remainder of the Elijah-expectation: the typology is satisfied, yet the archetype is not exhausted. The kingdom runs on recapitulations.\n\nThe decisive sting is “they didn’t recognize him.” Sirach’s Elijah is unmistakable—fire, horses, tempest, cosmic theater. Matthew’s Elijah is misrecognized, handled like disposable nuisance, “whatever they wanted.” That’s the inversion: in the new economy, the Elijah-function hides in the unglamorous and gets crushed by institutions. Recognition becomes a moral test: the powerful can only recognize power. Hence John-as-Elijah is an anti-miracle: not chariot-fire but prison and beheading, and precisely there the prophetic office is fulfilled. If you want the Strauss: the exoteric expectation is spectacle; the esoteric fulfillment is neg"
