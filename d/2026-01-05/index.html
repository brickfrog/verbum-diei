Ask and you will receive, because you have already obeyed; desire is permitted only after it has been domesticated. “Abide” becomes surveillance, the Spirit a receipt proving you’re inside the right intimacy.

Then comes the dread: not every spirit. The test is blunt, almost crude: say the right thing about flesh. The body is the battleground because the body is where people slip away. “Dissolving Jesus” is the urge to make him easier, purer, less embarrassing, less like need. Antichrist is not a monster but a soothing solvent.

Matthew’s Jesus begins when John is arrested, as if the kingdom feeds on the removal of the forerunner. He moves to a borderland, a mixed place, and calls it light, but the first word of that light is penance: a demand, not comfort. The healings read like conquest—torments, devils, lunacy—an inventory of misery drawn toward him by rumor and hunger. The crowds follow because pain loves a strong center, and because darkness will accept any light that promises a body to hold.</div></div><div class="semina-verbi"><div class="section-kicker is-strong">Semina Verbi</div><div class="semina-verbi-text">John binds efficacy in prayer to an inner congruence: you ask and receive because your wanting has been trained. “Commandment” collapses into a double fidelity—trust a person, love the others—and the promised “Spirit” reads like the felt seam where intention and action stop fighting. The warning about “spirits” is not occult; it is about contagious voices. Test them by whether they keep the story whole: the real arrives in flesh, not as an idea that dissolves the weight of bodies. “Antichrist” is the psychology of abstraction that flatters you out of responsibility.

Matthew shows how that voice moves through geography and mood: prison news, a retreat, then a public turn into Galilee’s mixed margins. Light is not a concept here; it is a campaign of attention—teaching, announcing, touching the sick. “Repent” is a change of direction because a new order is near enough to reorganize desire. The crowds follow not because they grasp a theory but because wholeness seems possible.

Semina Verbi: the “testing of spirits” resembles Buddhist discernment between wholesome and unwholesome mind-states and Stoic scrutiny of impressions; the insistence on flesh echoes Hindu avatara devotion and Jewish insistence that holiness lives in concrete commandments; the “light in darkness” aligns with Sufi imagery of illumination. Speculation: all of them aim at the same human problem—voices that promise transcendence by skipping the body—and answer it by yoking vision to love and repair.</div></div></section><footer class="page-footer"><div class="footer-note">Scripture text: <a class="source-link" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8300">Douay-Rheims 1899 American Edition (DRA)</a> — public domain.
