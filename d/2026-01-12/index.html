Hannah is trapped in a household economy where love is a consolation prize. Elkanah’s “portion with sorrow” is the tender cruelty of a man trying to buy peace without changing the structure that is breaking her. Peninnah’s taunts are not mere malice; they are the system speaking through her, policing the one woman whose body refuses to produce proof. “The Lord had shut up her womb” reads like a pious alibi for what everyone is already doing to Hannah: turning her absence into a verdict. When Elkanah asks, “Am not I better to thee than ten children?” he is not comforting her; he is demanding that she rename her hunger as ingratitude.

Then Mark turns the screw. “The time is accomplished” is not reassurance; it is a deadline. Jesus walks by working men and speaks like a recruiter: leave your nets, leave your father, come now. The seduction is the promise of a larger story, but the cost is amputative, immediate, unargued. Zebedee remains in the boat with hired men, a small detail that makes the abandonment sharper: this is not heroic poverty, it is a clean cut.

Put together, the readings sketch a world where intimacy is never neutral. Home uses love to domesticate longing; the kingdom uses urgency to break loyalties. Hannah’s grief and the fishermen’s sudden departure share the same dread: your life can be renamed by someone else, and your deepest want will be used to move you.</div></div><div class="semina-verbi"><div class="section-kicker is-strong">Semina Verbi</div><div class="semina-verbi-text">Hannah lives inside a small, cruel arithmetic: worth measured in children, love measured in portions, piety measured in annual trips. Peninnah weaponizes the one public fact that can’t be argued. The text refuses to sentimentalize infertility; it shows it as social exposure, a yearly ritual of humiliation, and a private collapse where food loses meaning. Elkanah’s tenderness lands as misattuned consolation. “Am not I better…?” is love trying to substitute itself for the one thing love cannot grant. He wants to close the wound by being the whole world to her; she needs him to name the wound as real.

Then Mark snaps to motion. The kingdom arrives as an interruption, not a concept. Fishermen are seen mid-task and called without negotiation. Nets, boats, father, payroll, the whole lattice of duty is cut. Repentance here is less remorse than reorientation: a new center of gravity that makes the old life instantly feel like excess weight. The call is clean because it is absolute.

Together they sketch one psyche: longing that cannot be soothed by substitutes, and a summons that cannot be postponed without betrayal of self. Hannah’s hunger is the ache of an unlived future; the disciples’ leaving is the violence of choosing one future and killing the others.

Semina Verbi: Hannah’s humiliation and steadfast longing echoes the Hindu figure of Kunti and the ache of lineage, and the Buddhist diagnosis of tanha as the engine of suffering, though that parallel is speculative because Hannah’s desire is also moral and relational, not merely grasping. The disciples’ abrupt renunciation resembles the Bhagavad Gita’s call to decisive action and the Zen motif of sudden awakening, and the Sufi idea of hijra, inner migration; speculative, but the shared note is the moment when a voice redefines reality faster than habit can argue.</div></div></section><footer class="page-footer"><div class="footer-note">Scripture text: <a class="source-link" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8300">Douay-Rheims 1899 American Edition (DRA)</a> — public domain.
