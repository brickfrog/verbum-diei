From these words Helvidius and other heretics most impiously inferred that the blessed Virgin Mary had other children besides Christ; but St. Jerome shews, by divers examples, that this expression of the Evangelist was a manner of speaking usual among the Hebrews, to denote by the word until, only what is done, without any regard to the future. Thus it is said, Genesis 8. 6 and 7, that Noe sent forth a raven, which went forth, and did not return till the waters were dried up on the earth. That is, did not return any more. Also Isaias 46. 4, God says: I am till you grow old. Who dare infer that God should then cease to be: Also in the first book of Machabees 5. 54, And they went up to mount Sion with joy and gladness, and offered holocausts, because not one of them was slain till they had returned in peace. That is, not one was slain before or after they had returned. God saith to his divine Son: Sit on my right hand till I make thy enemies thy footstool. Shall he sit no longer after his enemies are subdued? Yea and for all eternity. St. Jerome also proves by Scripture examples, that an only begotten son, was also called firstborn, or first begotten: because according to the law, the firstborn males were to be consecrated to God; Sanctify unto me, saith the Lord, every firstborn that openeth the womb among the children of Israel, etc. Ex. 13. 2.</span></p></article></section></div><section class="box commentary-box"><header class="section-header"><div class="section-kicker">Gloss</div><h2 class="section-title">Commentary</h2></header><div class="commentary-sections"><div class="commentary-section"><div class="section-kicker">On the Reading</div><ul class="comment-notes"><li class="comment-note"><a class="note-ref" data-hl="first-L1 first-L2" href="#first-L1">R 1,2</a><span class="note-text">The oracle does not promise novelty but a repaired Davidic mechanism: rule that is “wise” and executable.

What matters is not psychological development but the installation of names into social reality: adoption-by-naming binds messianic promise to a household, and presence is asserted inside ordinary domestic structure.</span></li></ul></div></div><p class="commentary-synthesis">Jeremiah promises a restored Davidic justice and a new national memory; Matthew supplies the mechanism: Davidic status transmitted through a “just” man who accepts a divinely caused irregularity. The old exodus is eclipsed by a wider return; the old lineage is preserved by a non-biological father. Both texts relocate legitimacy from visible continuity to God’s direct authorship of history.</p><div class="excursus"><div class="section-kicker">Excursus</div><div class="excursus-text">Jeremiah is doing royal propaganda with an eschatological patina: the “just branch” is less botanical than dynastic—Davidic legitimacy laundered through righteousness. The subtext is that the present kings are rotten, so God must reintroduce kingship as a moral technology: wisdom → judgment → justice. But the real pivot is vv.7–8: the Exodus gets demoted. Israel’s primal identity-myth (“out of Egypt”) is to be surpassed by a second, more politically legible miracle: repatriation from “the land of the north” (code for the imperial grinder: Assyria/Babylon and, later, any hegemon with a compass). This is not merely comfort; it’s a revision of national memory. God doesn’t just save—He edits what counts as the definitive salvation.

Matthew then performs a highly self-aware splice: he needs Davidic descent and divine paternity simultaneously, so he makes Joseph both essential and dispensable. The angel’s address “son of David” is a legal fiction with liturgical force: Joseph confers the dynastic line by naming, while being carefully sidelined sexually. Naming is the sacrament of patriarchy; intercourse would be the contamination. That’s why Joseph’s “justice” is foregrounded: he is a just man precisely by accepting a humiliation that preserves the public fiction. His righteousness is obedience to a narrative.

If Jeremiah’s king will “execute judgment,” Matthew’s king will “save his people from their sins”—an inwardization that looks like spiritual profundity but also a shrewd depoliticization. Jeremiah promises territorial consolidation (“dwell in their own land”); Matthew relocates the battlefield to the psyche. You can read that as escalation (sin is the deeper exile) or as strategic retreat (Rome stays, but guilt moves in). The Straussian tell is the double register: exoteric fulfillment-citation (“that it might be fulfilled…”) masking an esoteric regime change in what “salvation” means.

The Emmanuel citation is also a typological coup. Isaiah’s original sign is politically immediate; Matthew mines it for metaphysical permanence. “God with us” becomes not merely a slogan but an ontological claim strapped onto a very human scandal: an irregular pregnancy. The text keeps insisting on legitimacy (David, prophecy, angelic warrant) because the surface story invites cynicism. Matthew writes like someone who knows how incredulous the audience is.

Then the commentary about Helvidius and “till” is an instructive intrusion: orthodoxy doing damage control by philology, as if grammar could police metaphysics. Jerome’s argument is competent as rhetoric (Semitic “until” doesn’t entail reversal), but it’s also revealing: the anxiety isn’t linguistic, it’s symbolic. Mary must be sealed because she functions as the Ark motif—holiness as inaccessibility. If she has ordinary marital life, the Incarnation risks looking like one extraordinary event inside an otherwise ordinary reproductive economy; but the tradition wants it to feel like a categorical rupture.

So the juxtaposition: Jeremiah promises a restored polity under a just ruler whose greatness reorders national memory; Matthew offers a ruler whose advent reorders ontology and whose justice begins as Joseph’s submission to a paradox. One is a politics of return; the other is a politics of reinterpretation. And the most subversive continuity is that both are about legitimacy—who gets to call the story true, and by what authorized name.</div></div><div class="semina-verbi"><div class="section-kicker">Semina Verbi</div><div class="semina-verbi-text">A hope for a “just branch” and a wise king who sets judgment and justice in the earth resonates with a widespread intuition that legitimate authority is measured less by force than by righteousness. Confucian tradition speaks of the Mandate of Heaven as morally conditioned, and the ideal of the junzi-ruler whose virtue orders society. In Islamic thought, the figure of the Mahdi (and, for many, the return of Jesus) also gathers expectations of restored justice; Judaism’s messianic hope similarly holds together fidelity to God with the repair of communal life. These parallels are not identical, but they point to a shared moral grammar: history is answerable to a standard beyond mere power.

The memory of liberation shifting from a single founding rescue to a larger ingathering from exile mirrors how many traditions understand salvation as both personal and communal, and as something that can be re-experienced in new historical forms. The Jewish Passover pattern is paradigmatic here, but one can also see analogies with Sikh memory of deliverance and formation under pressure, or with the way Islamic consciousness ties remembrance of Hijra and return to a living identity. Even in philosophical traditions like Stoicism, the image of being “brought back” can be interiorized as recall from dispersion into integrity: the self regathered under reason and virtue.

Joseph’s predicament highlights a moral tension that appears across cultures: how to hold justice together with mercy when social norms would permit public shaming. Rabbinic Judaism develops careful distinctions between judgment tempered by compassion; Islamic adab and jurisprudence also weigh concealment of another’s fault against public harm, privileging discretion when possible. In Mahayana Buddhism, compassion does not abolish discernment, but asks whether an action reduces suffering for all involved; Joseph’s restraint can be read, at least analogically, as the choice to minimize harm without abandoning moral seriousness.

Guidance through a dream belongs to a broad human repertoire of discerning the divine or the deep moral order in the symbolic life of the mind. The Hebrew Bible itself is filled with such moments, but similar respect for dreams appears in Islam (true dreams as a form of good tidings), in many Hindu and Buddhist narratives where insight arrives in liminal states, and in Indigenous traditions that treat dreams as a venue of counsel. A cautious philosophical parallel would be Jung’s view of dreams as bearers of meaning that can reorient a life; the texts press further, presenting the dream not merely as psyche but as summons.

The naming of the child as a mission (“he will save”) and as presence (“God with us”) has echoes in traditions where a name is more than a label: in Judaism, names often compress vocation; in Hindu traditions, divine names (nama) are understood to carry real participation in the divine; in Islam, the Beautiful Names shape moral imitation and worship. The deeper motif is that reality is not mute: it calls, and the call can be spoken into a life.

Finally, the theme of purity and the guardedness around intimate boundaries can be placed alongside vows and renunciations across religions—Buddhist and Jain celibacy, Hindu brahmacharya, Christian monasticism—while noting that the point is not contempt for embodiment but a sign that certain purposes are received rather than engineered. Whether one shares the specific doctrinal claims or not, the moral intuition is recognizable: there are moments when fidelity means making room for a gift, accepting reputational cost, and letting one’s plans be redirected by a justice that arrives as grace.</div></div></section><footer class="page-footer"><div class="footer-note">Scripture text: <a class="source-link" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8300">Douay-Rheims 1899 American Edition (DRA)</a> — public domain.
